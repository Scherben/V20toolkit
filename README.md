# V20toolkit
A tool for Vampire Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition. 

This tool provides Information for Disciplines, Merits, Flaws, Rituals and so on. At the moment there is only the possibility to create, edit, delete and save Changes for Nature/Demeanours and Merits/Flaws.

It is by far not finished. On one hand this tool is for practical use of JavaFX and general practice in programming following MVC directives, on the other Hand it is based on my interest in the possibility to gain easy viewable V20 content for me as a V20 Gamemaster. 

Because this repository is public there is no actual content for this due to possible copyright infringement of written texts. In this state there is actual no gain for anybody who does not own a copy of the offiecial pdf of the Core Rulebook Vampire Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition.
